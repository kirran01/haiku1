                                Welcome to Math Hero.

The objective of the game is simple; answer the questions prompted accurately to secure points and move onto the next question. You have a total of 10 seconds to answer each question. The amount of points you receive will increase directly proportional to how much time is remaining, so answer questions as quickly as possible to maximize your score. If the answer is incorrect or the timer runs out, that results in a loss and you will be prompted to start over.


There are three levels to Math Hero:

Level 1: Fundamentals - Addition and Subtraction.

Level 2: Full Arithmitic - Multiplication and Division.

Level 3: Algebraic - Find the value of a given variable.

Good luck ;)
